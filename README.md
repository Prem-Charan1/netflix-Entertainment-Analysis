# Netflix-Entertainment-Analysis and Dashboard

This project is focused on analyzing public sentiment expressed on social media platforms. It combines **Python**  and **data cleaning** with **Power BI** for building an interactive data visualization dashboard.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to:
- Clean and preprocess raw Netflix text data.
- preprocess the dataset using Python. remove unnecessary columns, filled or dropped missing values, and cleaned the text by eliminating URLs, hashtags, emojis, punctuations, and common stopwords.
- Visualize insights using a Power BI dashboard.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas)
- **Power BI**
- **VS Code**

## Folder Structure 
1. Netflix_Analysis.py (python file to clean data)
2. Netflix_title(Noisy Data)
3. Netflix_cleaned(preprocessed Data)
4. Netflix_Dashboard( Insights about Netflix)

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ Data Collection from Kaggle's Netflix dataset (TV shows & movies metadata)

✅ Data Cleaning using Python (Pandas, NumPy): handled nulls, duplicates, column formatting

🌍 Top 10 countries contributing the most content

📈 Content growth trend over the years

🎭 A clear comparison between TV Shows and Movies over time

📊 Most active directors by year

📌 And a breakdown of content types using a pie chart
